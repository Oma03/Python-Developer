"""Python loop
Python has two primitive loop commands
The while loop and the for loop

The while loop
with the while loop you can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true
Example
print i as long as i is less than 6
Note: remember to increment i unless the loop will go on forever
The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready
"""
# i = 1
# while i < 6:
#     print(i)
#     i += 1
#
# names = ['patience', 'joy', 'stanley', 'oma']
# i = 0
# while i < 4:
#     print(names[i])
#     i += 1
"""
The break statement
With the break statement, we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true
Example
Exit the loop when i is 3
"""
# i = 1
# while i < 6:
#     print(i)
#     if i == 3:
#         break
#     i += 1
"""..
The continue statement 
this statement skips the condition when condition is reached and moves on with other conditions"""
# i = 4
# while i < 20:
#     i += 3
#     if i == 7:
#         continue
#     print(i)
